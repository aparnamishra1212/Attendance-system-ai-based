# AI-Based Attendance System

## Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for an AI-based attendance system developed using Python and various libraries. The system was created as part of a project associated with VIT Bhopal University from September 2022 to January 2023.

## Project Description
The AI-based attendance system differs from traditional systems by enhancing not only the ability to mark attendance but also the accuracy of the graphical user interface (GUI) and the usability of the database. Unlike other systems that only recognize faces and mark attendance, this system aims to provide a more comprehensive solution.

## Features
- Face recognition for attendance marking
- Improved GUI for better user experience
- Easy-to-use database management
- Python programming language utilized for development

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries (mention specific libraries used, e.g., OpenCV, TensorFlow, etc.)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Follow the instructions in the documentation to set up and run the AI-based attendance system.
